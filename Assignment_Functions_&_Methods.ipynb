A classification model is a model which classifies a given observation or an event to a fixed set of categories. Suppose I train a machine learning model to classify images of cats and dogs. For each image, the machine classifies the image with either a <code>'Cat'</code> or a <code>'Dog'</code>. So in essence for each input image, there is a corresponding output by the model. This output can either be a <code>'Cat'</code> or a <code>'Dog'</code>.\n",

You train a machine learning model to classify these images into cats and dogs. The machine predicts 9 cats correctly and 8 dogs correctly. The accuracy of the model is then defined as (correctly predicted cats and dogs)/(total cats and dogs). In this case it is (9+8)/(11+9) = 17/20 = 0.85 or 85%.
